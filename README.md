# Member database project

Inspired by https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-secret-to-being-a-top-developer-is-building-things-heres-a-list-of-fun-apps-to-build-aac61ac0736c , I built the Fintastic member database dashboard as a Create-Read-Update-Delete project, using PHP and javascript.

The user is able to create new members, view all members, view a full record for a selected member, edit that member record, and delete it.  Passwords are validated for length using javascript.

This is the beginning of an app I plan to build allowing a club dive master to record dives and payments for club members, hence the diving theme.
